## Requirements
Create an application that displays a board of recipes for the week.  
This board will show the recipe titles organized into sections. Each section represents a day of the week, so there will be 7 sections for the 7 days of the week.  
The user will be able to create as many recipes as needed for the same day.  

The data to display and create are as follows:  
- Title  
- Date the recipe is created  
- Optionally, a list of ingredients  
- Optionally, the preparation method  

A filter will be available to search by week.  

When the user enters the application, the section for the current day's recipes should be highlighted.  

The user can edit a recipe and change any information.  
The user can also delete a recipe.
